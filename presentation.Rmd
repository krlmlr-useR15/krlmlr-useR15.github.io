## Algorithm engineering

> Design, analysis, implementation, optimization, profiling and experimental evaluation of computer algorithms. (*Wikipedia*)

Here: Substitute existing implementation by an algorithm
with a lower computational complexity.

**Examples**

1. Weighted random sampling without replacement
2. Similarity-based statistical matching
3. Survey calibration
4. Package management


## Random sampling

```{r}
sample.int
```

- `replace`: With or without replacement
- `prob`: Uniform or non-uniform probabilities


## Implementation of random sampling

Common framework:

- Subdivide an interval according to probabilities
- Choose sub-interval by sampling a uniform point in interval
- If sampling without replacement, remove sub-interval
