## Algorithm engineering

> Design, analysis, implementation, optimization, profiling and experimental evaluation of computer algorithms. (*Wikipedia*)

Here: Substitute existing implementation by an algorithm
with a lower computational complexity.

### Examples

1. Weighted random sampling without replacement
2. Similarity-based statistical matching
3. Survey calibration
4. Package management
